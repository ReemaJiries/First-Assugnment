adding new node with the given data to the list.
changeNode:
accepts index if the node to be changed, starting from 1, and data of integer type, no default value.
change the data of the node with the given index.
getData:
k - index of the k element in the linked list starting from 1.
ofind the kth to last element of a singly linked list.
